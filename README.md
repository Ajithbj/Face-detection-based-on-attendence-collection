# Face-detection-based-on-attendence-collection
It involved building a system for face detection and face recognition using Convolutional Neural Network Algorithm (CNN). Face detection refers to the 
technology capable of identifying or verifying the identity of subjects in images or videos. Face 
detection is usually the first step towards many face-related technologies, such as face 
recognition or verification. However, face detection can have very useful applications. In this 
project we are trying to implement efficient automated attendance marker using face detection.

Taking and tracking attendance manually, losing attendance sheets, dishonesty, wasted time 
and high error scales are problems faced by lecturers using the existing attendance system. It 
is a hard process, time taking and cause a lot of paper-based work.
